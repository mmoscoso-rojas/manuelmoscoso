    "text": "My customisations AKA how long could this possibly take?\nI didn’t think it would take too long to make some tweaks, but the more I worked on the site, the more I wanted to change. I’ve managed, with help, to implement customisations that I haven’t seen or read about elsewhere in relation to Quarto. Getting a basic Quarto site up is relatively straight-forward (in fact, Tom Mock shows how it can be done in just 100 seconds), but extensive customisation, particularly when starting with a rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS, turned out to be pretty tricky.\nIn this section, I’m going to list what I think are the cool features of this site, all of which I had to learn how to implement as I went along. Some of them are Quarto-specific. Others I expect will be fairly standard to those with a more advanced knowledge of front-end web development, but may well also be new to others who, like me, have come to website-building with Quarto from a backgroud in R programming rather than HTML/CSS/JS.\nFor the sake of brevity, in this post I don’t detail how I achieved these customisations. I just note what I had to learn to implement them. I intend to spin each of the points below into separate tutorial-style blog posts. If you’re interested in seeing how I implemented them in the meantime, you can check out this site’s repo.\n\nAnimated CSS logo\nMy favourite feature of my website is the logo/home link in the top left corner, which is animated on hover.1 To implement this, I had to learn first how to create and style the static version using HTML and CSS and then how to apply the CSS animation. I also had to figure out what HTML I could get away with using in _quarto.yml and the best place in that file to add the code. There were also inconsistencies between browers to contend with. I was inspired to animate my logo by Maya Gans, who helped me a lot with the implementation.\nCreating a logo with CSS also made it possible to easily change its appearance in the light and dark modes of the site. Along the way, I also learnt another strategy for using different logo images in light and dark modes, using CSS to overwrite one image file with another, which is useful if a logo doesn’t lend itself to creation in CSS.\n\n\nAnimated navigation bar links and colours\nHaving animated my logo, I turned to adding an animation on hover to the rest of the links on the navigation bar and learnt more CSS in the process, including @media queries to ensure that the animations only activate when the navbar is in a row. I found a solution online for the animation itself, but figuring out how to match the colours on hover and on the link for the active page to the colour of the corresponding card on the homepage was tricky.\n\n\nCSS grid and bootstrap cards\nSpeaking of which, creating the custom layout of my homepage, using CSS grid and bootstrap cards, was a challenge. The blog posts by Albert and Christian linked to in the previous section got me a lot of the way there, but I still had to dive deep into the bootstrap documentation to make sure the cards and the links inside them all lined up nicely.\n\n\nLight and dark mode\nI put a lot of thought into the colour scheme for both the light and dark modes of the site, and making sure they complemented each other perfectly. For this, I built on what I’d learnt about colour theory and accessibility when designing a custom syntax highlight scheme for my previous website. I also learnt about Sass and made extensive use of custom Sass variables.\n\n\nCustom syntax highlighting\nHaving implemented a custom syntax highlight theme for my {distill} site, and created a function for the {distilltools} package so others could do the same, I had hoped to be able to port that straight over to my Quarto site. Unfortunately, it wasn’t so simple. Although they are both called arrow, there are changes in the implementation of the default syntax highlight scheme for Quarto from how it was implemented in {distill}, and, to make things more awkward, there are also inconsistencies between the light and dark versions of arrow in Quarto. It took me a while to get my head around all that. Modifying my original highlighting theme and creating a complementary theme for the dark mode was finicky.\n\n\ngiscus comments box light/dark toggle\nQuarto makes it easy to add giscus comments boxes, and giscus (and in turn Quarto) make it simple to select from a handful of different themes to style those boxes. There are a selection of light and dark themes, and one option to set the default light or dark theme dynamically based on your computer system setting. There was not, however, an obvious way of making the theme of the giscus box change responsively on toggling the light/dark switch. In response to my query, with a lot of back and forth, Sage (the creator of giscus) figured out the JavaScript to make this happen and I figured out how to integrate it into the Quarto site.\nI would like to apply custom CSS to the giscus comments box in both light and dark modes, which should be possible. I haven’t yet been able to make it work, though, which appears to be an issue related to hosting on Netlify.\n\n\nLocal fonts and open type font features\nBecause I’m interested in typography and think that professional fonts are worth paying for, and in order to give my site a distinct appearance, I purchased licenses for Lemon Milk Pro (used for body and header text) and MonoLisa (used for code). Having done so, I then had to learn the CSS/Sass to apply the local font files to the site. I also learnt all about open type font features, and how to turn them on and off using CSS. I needed this to turn off the default coding ligatures in MonoLisa.2\n\n\nIcon links\nAs on my {distill} site, I’ve made copious use of the icon_link() function in my {distilltools} package, a handy R function that creates a link, with an icon and some text that, with some additional CSS, can be styled a bit like a button, e.g. the code\nhttps://ellakaye.co.uk/contact.html\ndistilltools::icon_link(\n  icon = \"github\",\n  text = \"site repo\",\n  url = \"https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk\"\n)"

    "text": "Personal life\nI live in Denver, CO, with my Golden Retriever, Oliver. Born in Budapest, Hungary, I’ve spent my formative years in England, but have called the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Austria and the United States home at various points in my life. Since 2020, I’ve been living in the United States, where I am a permanent resident.\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading (mostly Cold War history and classical Greek drama), cooking (with not a lot of success) and Renaissance polyphony (esp. Thomas Tallis and Orlando di Lasso). I’m credited for a somewhat pretty sequence of integers called Jellyfish Heart numbers (OEIS A344856), which I discovered in 2020 while doing something that has nothing at all to do with my day job.\nI live with neuromyelitis optica since 2015, which has left me with a lifelong desire to understand complex, multicausal health conditions like NMOSD better.\nIn what little is left of my free time, I’m an adaptive multisport athlete, competing in wheelchair rugby, adaptive rowing (category PR1) and the SkiErg (category SIT2). In the latter, I currently hold the world records for 100m, 500m, 1,000m, 2,000m, 6,000m, 10,000m, 21,097m and 42,195m distances and the 60 minutes time. I occasionally rant and whine about my forays in the world of adaptive exercise and my attempts at doing so in a mostly science-based manner."

    "text": "I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Brown University, specializing in Comparative Politics and Research Methods. My research lies at the intersection of distributive politics and the politics of public security. I’m particularly interested in designing and evaluating crime prevention initiatives and programs that promote the integration of police authorities into society, especially in areas with high demand for state presence. Most of my work employs a quantitative approach, utilizing experimental and observational methods. My research interests include Latin American politics and the role of policing institutions state and non-state in authoritarian and non-authoritarian regimes.\nPreviously, I received a B.A. in Economics from Universidad Javeriana, a M.Sc.in Economics from Universidad Javeriana, and a M.A. in Political Science from Brown University."

    "text": "Causes and Consequences of the Uneven Distribution of Public Security in Colombia\nWhy do states provide security to some places and not others within their borders? Who are the primary beneficiaries of the security provision in rural areas? How does the uneven distribution of security affect citizen-state relations? Despite renewed interest in understanding the states’ uneven territorial reach, little we know about why states prioritize the expansion of their security apparatus to some places and not others and its consequences on state-citizen relations. Using original qualitative and quantitative data from Colombia, this project unpacks the decision-making process of allocating and distributing police infrastructure in Colombia. It explores its impact on various facets, including the emergence of conflict resolution strategies, the coordination and division of labor between communities and police, the capacities of both community members and law enforcement, and the prevailing perceptions of security and coexistence. This is a three-paper dissertation which focused on the case of Colombia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. War-to-Peace Transition: A Case Study of Colombia’s Law-and-Order Politics \nWhy do states provide security to some places and not others within their borders? Who are the primary beneficiaries of the security provision in rural areas?\nData collection: Primary and secondary information from official sources and non-governmental organizations.\n\n\n2. Consequences of the Uneven Distribution of Security in Colombia \nWhy do states provide security to some places and not others within their borders? Who are the primary beneficiaries of the security provision in rural areas?\nData collection: Four original surveys applied in 66 populated centers of four subregions in Colombia.\n\n\n3. Community Monitors to Solve the Dilemmas of Rural Policing: A Randomized Evaluation in Colombia \nDoes supplying police officers with information from community monitors generate accountability pressure to improve public goods provision and citizen satisfaction? Could bottom-up accountability initiatives improve police-citizens relations? Are community monitors in rural areas an effective strategy to aggregate citizens’ security preferences? This project attempts to answer these questions through an RCT in rural villages in Colombia by activating community monitors using communal institutions.\nData collection: Baseline data supported by J-PAL\n\n\n\n\n\nData collection"
