Hello, and welcome to my new site, built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org){target="_blank"}. Hereâ€™s why I switched from [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/){target="_blank"} and the resources that helped me in the process. I also outline some of the customisations I made and set out plans for future blog posts.

## Why Quarto? Why now?

I was very happy with my previous [website built using {distill}](../2021-05-08_welcome-distill/index.qmd). Then Quarto was released and it quickly became clear that everything that I loved about working with {distill} was true of Quarto, and then some. As a keen user of a whole suite of packages in the R Markdown ecosystem, I could see the appeal of one coherent system to produce reports, presentations, books and websites. Moreover, Quarto is the natural successor to R Markdown, bringing with it a vast range of improvements, building on what [Posit](https://posit.co) (formerly RStudio) learnt over a decade of developing the latter. When it was made clear that although Posit will maintain {distill}, all future improvements will be to Quarto, I knew it was only a matter of time before I rewrote my website once again (for the fourth time).

I'm finding working with Quarto to be an absolute joy!

## Resources

This post is not a guide on how to get a Quarto website up and running and styled. There are already great resources for that. These are the the ones that I found most helpful.
