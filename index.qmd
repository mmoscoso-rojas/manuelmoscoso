### Bio

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Brown University, specializing in Comparative Politics and Research Methods. My research interests include war-to-peace transitions, Latin American politics, and the intersection of distributive politics and the politics of public security, with a particular interest in designing and evaluating crime prevention initiatives and programs that promote the (re)integration of police authorities into society. Most of my work employs a quantitative approach, utilizing both experimental and observational methods.

I hold a B.A. and M.Sc. in Economics from Universidad Javeriana and an M.A. in Political Science from Brown University.

My work has received funding from Brown University, J-PAL, UNDP, and IOM. I have contributed in various capacities to the International Justice Mission, USAID, the Policy and Strategy Division in the Colombian Prosecution Office, the Security and Justice Division of the National Planning Department, and the Conflict Analysis Resources Center (CERAC).

### Key research interests

-   **The Politics of Public Security**: Police-society interactions, the role of policing institutions in authoritarian and non-authoritarian regimes
-   **War-to-Peace and Peace-to-War Transitions**: Rebel governance, contemporary state-building, war and peace funding
